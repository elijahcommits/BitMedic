# BitMedic 🖥️ Troubleshooting & PC Help

Hello AI! This project is for **BitMedic**, a remote PC helpdesk service. Our goal is to create a user-friendly website where people can learn about our services and get remote help with their computer troubles. The site has a fun, retro Windows-inspired theme!

## 🎯 Purpose of this Site

* To act as the main online presence for the BitMedic helpdesk.
* To clearly describe the remote PC support services offered.
* To provide an easy way for potential clients to understand the service and how to get help.

## ✨ Key Features & Theme

* **Retro UI:** The website embraces a "classic Windows" aesthetic. This is reflected in:
    * The main dialogue box on the landing page.
    * The custom Windows-style toolbar and Start menu.
* **User-Friendly:** Despite the retro look, the site aims to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
* **Remote First:** The core message is that BitMedic provides expert PC support remotely.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
